intro: |
  I am a health economist currently funded by a Wellcome Trust PhD scholarship in Public Health Economics and Decision Science at the University of Sheffield, UK.<br/><br/> 
  My research is focused on the application of methods from health economics and data science to public health.<br/><br/> 
  I have a specific interest in physical activity, my PhD focuses on the methods used by economists to estimate the costs and benefits associated with changes in population physical activity.<br/><br/> 
  I have become increasingly interested in the use of data-science to improve the transparency of economic models, and have developed several R-Shiny applications to aid decision makers.<br/><br/>
  I teach epidemiology and medical statistics to undergraduates, advanced simulation methods to postgraduates, and R/Rshiny as short courses. <br/><br/>
  I was a recipient of a Sheffield Sport Scholarship in Athletics.
