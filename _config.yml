intro: |
  Health Economist currently funded by a Wellcome Trust PhD scholarship in Public Health Economics and Decision Science at the University of Sheffield, UK. Open access work can be found here: https://robertasmith.github.io/about_me/ 
  My research is focused on the methods used by economists to estimate the costs and benefits associated with changes in population physical activity, with a specific interest in micro-simulation techniques in R. I have become increasingly interested in the use of data-science to improve the transparency of economic models, and have developed several R-Shiny applications to aid decision makers.
  I teach epidemiology and medical statistics to undergraduates, advanced simulation methods to postgraduates, and 'Introduction to R' as a Short Course. I was a recipient of a Sheffield Sport Scholarship in Athletics.

   <strong>R</strong>: My current role uses Scala as the primary language and have been building applications in Scala for the last two years. I am familiar with a range of Scala libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2017/12/an-opinionated-guide-to-building-apis.html"> Akka-Http for building microservices</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/09/generic-programming-with-scala.html"> Shapeless for generic programming</a>, as well as familiar with a range of <a target="_blank" href="https://basementcrowd.com/2018/11/28/scala-the-aux-pattern-path-dependent-types/" >functional programming techniques available</a>.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Simul8</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others. <br/><br/>
   <strong>STATA</strong> I have used Groovy as a language in production for ~4 years and I am familiar with many of the languages features (such as writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>) and quirks (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/groovy-retrospective-an-addendum-memory-usage-perm">memory leak issues</a>). <br/><br/>
   <strong>Excel VBA</strong>: I have primarily used AWS for running production apps on the cloud. I have experience setting up, configuring and running applications using a range of AWS offerings, including EC2, RDS, S3, Cogito, <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/serverless-with-aws-lambda-scala.html">Lambda</a> and its more recent <a target="_blank" href="https://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/10/machine-learning-with-aws-scala.html">Machine Learning capabilities</a>.<br/><br/>
   <strong>R-Shiny</strong>: I have considerable experience working with R-Shiny to create user interfaces for health economic models. These are being used in a variety of settings including by the WHO Dept Sexual Health.
